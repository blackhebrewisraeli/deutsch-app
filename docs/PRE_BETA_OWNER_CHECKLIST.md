# Pre-beta owner checklist

**Owner-only.** Manual dashboard steps for when the owner is back. Nothing
here can be finished from the repo: each item needs the Supabase, Vercel,
GitHub, or Google Cloud console. Agents must not apply production
migrations, rotate keys, disable Google auth, or delete users.

Companion runbooks:

- Magic Link template + redirect URLs → `docs/AUTH_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_RUNBOOK.md`
- Google OAuth provider → `docs/AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH_RUNBOOK.md`
- Recurring owner actions that stay queued → `docs/BACKLOG.md`

Do **not** paste secret values into chat, tickets, or commit messages. Confirm
presence and last-rotated date only.

---

## 1. Confirm or rotate the Supabase secret / service_role key

Only if a leak is confirmed (secret-scanning alert, paste in a ticket, or a
`VITE_`-prefixed copy in Vercel).

1. Supabase → project **Sprachschule** → **Settings → API Keys**.
2. Rotate the **secret** / legacy **service_role** key. Do not create a new
   key *named* `service_role` — that name is reserved.
3. Vercel → project → **Settings → Environment Variables** → update
   **`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`** on Production and Preview.
   - **Never** `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Vite inlines every `VITE_*`
     var into the public bundle.
4. Redeploy. The functions read this at runtime; a dashboard edit without a
   new deploy is enough for serverless, but Preview branches that were built
   with a stale value still need a rebuild if anything baked it in.

If no leak is confirmed, skip rotation. Presence of the key in Vercel is
expected.

## 2. Review GitHub secret-scanning alerts

GitHub → **Security → Secret scanning**. Open every alert.

- A real cloud service_role / secret key, Anthropic key, or Sentry write
  token → treat as a leak and rotate (step 1 / the matching provider).
- A false positive from a placeholder (`your_local_service_role_key_here`)
  → dismiss with a note. `.env.example` already uses a non-triggering
  placeholder for the local service-role key for this reason.

## 3. Magic Link template + redirect URLs

**Magic Link template + OTP expiry — owner-applied 2026-09-18** in project
Sprachschule. Hosted Magic Link body matches the repo template (footer:
"This code expires in five minutes."). Email OTP / magic-link expiry is
**300 seconds (5 minutes)** in the dashboard; `supabase/config.toml`
`[auth.email] otp_expiry` matches. JWT expiry is unchanged.

Hosted Auth still does not pick up later repo edits by itself. After any
future template change, re-paste via `docs/AUTH_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_RUNBOOK.md`.

**Redirect URLs — still owner-only / unverified from the repo:**

1. **Authentication → URL Configuration**:
   - Site URL → `https://deutsch-app-dusky.vercel.app`
   - Redirect URLs → production origin, `http://localhost:5173`,
     `http://127.0.0.1:5173` (exact match, no wildcards for the local pair)

Send one real magic-link email after any later template paste and confirm
both the 6-digit code and the link still sign in.

## 4. Auth custom domain / Google OAuth branding

Google's consent screen and redirect currently show
`xcnnlczvxmuwcqwychox.supabase.co` (see
`docs/AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH_RUNBOOK.md` §4). That hostname is the public API
subdomain, not a secret, but it looks like an unverified third party.

Decide and, if shipping, do both:

1. Supabase → **Authentication → Custom Domains** (or Auth Hooks / URL
   config, depending on plan) — put Auth behind a first-party host.
2. Google Cloud → **Clients** → authorized redirect URI must become the
   **new** `/auth/v1/callback`, not the old `*.supabase.co` URL. Leaving
   the old URI is the usual `redirect_uri_mismatch`.

Do **not** disable the Google provider while doing this. The live flag
`VITE_GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED` stays on.

## 5. Registration policy (optional email allowlist)

**After #294.** The gate is in the repo; enabling it is Vercel env, not
another PR. Google signup is currently **open**. That is how
`fateevvl@gmail.com` got an account. The optional allowlist locks signup
for beta **without a code change and without touching the Google provider**.

**Default (do nothing):** `SIGNUP_EMAIL_ALLOWLIST` and
`VITE_SIGNUP_EMAIL_ALLOWLIST` unset or empty → current behaviour. Anyone
who completes Google or magic-link can keep a session. Production stays
open until you set these.

**To close signup for beta:**

1. Vercel → project → **Settings → Environment Variables**.
2. Add **`SIGNUP_EMAIL_ALLOWLIST`** (server, not `VITE_`) on Production
   and Preview, comma-separated. Example:
   `esterkinshimon712@gmail.com,friend@example.com`
   - Exact match after trim + lowercase. No plus-address aliasing.
   - Always include `esterkinshimon712@gmail.com` or you lock yourself out
     of account/admin APIs.
3. Add **`VITE_SIGNUP_EMAIL_ALLOWLIST`** with the **same list**. Vite
   inlines `VITE_*` at build time; this is the client UX so a rejected
   user sees "This email isn't invited" instead of a generic failure.
   Server enforcement still holds if you only set the non-`VITE_` var
   (privileged `/api/v1/*` calls 403 `signup_not_allowed`), but the
   session can look signed-in until they hit an API.
4. **Redeploy.** Env edits do not rebuild the client bundle on their own.
5. Smoke-test: sign in as the admin mailbox (must work). Try a second
   Google account that is not on the list — the app must sign that
   session out and explain closed beta. Guests (Continue without account)
   must still work. Google itself stays enabled.

Do **not** flip `enable_signup` in the Supabase dashboard. Do **not**
disable the Google provider. Do **not** delete users from an agent
session. Existing Auth users (including `fateevvl@gmail.com`) stay in
`auth.users`; they simply cannot keep a session while the list is on
unless you add them. Remove both vars and redeploy to re-open signup.

The gate lives in `requireAuth` (`api/_lib/auth-middleware.js`), which
every account / league / progress / admin handler already calls. Guests
never present a JWT.

## 6. Decision on `fateevvl@gmail.com`

An unexpected Google signup. Options: **block** (admin v1,
`profiles.blocked_at`), **delete** (B3 export/delete), or **keep**.

Do **not** delete the user from an agent session. If blocking, use the
admin UI as the owner. Note the choice next to this item.

## 7. Enable leaked-password protection

Supabase advisor WARN `auth_leaked_password_protection` is currently
firing: Auth is not checking passwords against HaveIBeenPwned.

Dashboard: **Authentication → Attack Protection** (or **Providers → Email**
password security) → enable **Leaked password protection**.

This is a hosted Auth setting. Editing `supabase/config.toml` only affects
local `supabase start`.

## 8. Apply pending security-hardening migrations — ⚠️ ONE OUTSTANDING (8c)

Two files were applied on 2026-09-21, in this order: **#290 then #293**
(BACKLOG owner actions #6 then #7). A **third arrived on 2026-09-22**
(§8c, the `profile_follows` follow-up to #316) and is **not applied**.

8a and 8b are kept below as the record of what ran and how it was
verified. 8c is the one still to do.

Verified 2026-09-21 by production read-only check plus Migration Drift
CI — see *Verification* below. No `supabase migration repair`, `db push`,
`db pull`, `db reset`, or MCP apply was used; the SQL ran verbatim in the
Sprachschule dashboard SQL editor.

### 8a. `#290` — `is_league_member` off the PostgREST surface

Repo file: `supabase/migrations/20260918200000_revoke_is_league_member_execute.sql`.

**✅ Applied 2026-09-21** (`schema_migrations` name
`revoke_is_league_member_execute`). Code landed as #290. Moves
`is_league_member` to schema
`private` (not in PostgREST's exposed schemas) and points both league RLS
policies at it. `authenticated` keeps `EXECUTE` there — PostgreSQL checks
that privilege when evaluating RLS, so revoking it in `public` 42501'd
every league SELECT. Dropping the public function is what closes
`/rpc/is_league_member`.

After it runs: sign in, open Stats → Ligen, confirm standings load. A
42501 on that SELECT means the private-schema grants did not land; do not
recreate `public.is_league_member`.

### 8b. `#293` — deny-all policies on server-only tables

Repo file: `supabase/migrations/20260918213000_server_only_rls_deny_policies.sql`.

**✅ Applied 2026-09-21** (`schema_migrations` name
`server_only_rls_deny_policies`), after 8a / the #290 migration as
required. Code landed as #293. Adds deny-all RLS policies (`USING false` / `WITH CHECK false`)
for `anon` and `authenticated` on `rate_limits` and `progress_events_seen`.
RLS stays enabled. No client grants. `service_role` keeps `GRANT ALL` (it
bypasses RLS). Learners never hit these tables; there is no UI smoke test.
Confirm advisor INFO `rls_enabled_no_policy` clears for both tables, and
Migration Drift sees the new name.

Ignore a red **Supabase Preview** check — that asks the inverse question
and is stale on `main` on purpose (`AGENTS.md`).

### 8c. `#316` follow-up — deny-all policies on `profile_follows`

Repo file: `supabase/migrations/20260921210000_profile_follows_deny_policies.sql`.

**NOT APPLIED — owner action.** Apply it in the Sprachschule dashboard SQL
editor, after the two above (they are already applied). No
`migration repair`, `db push`, `db reset`, or MCP apply.

`#316` added `public.profile_follows` with RLS enabled and every grant
revoked from `anon` and `authenticated`, which already denies the Data
API — the table is **fail-closed today and this is not a vulnerability**.
Supabase advisor INFO 0008 (`rls_enabled_no_policy`) flags it anyway,
because "RLS on, no policies" cannot be told apart from a forgotten
policy.

That ambiguity is the whole reason to fix it. On this schema a table with
no policy should always mean somebody forgot; §8b settled that convention
for `rate_limits` and `progress_events_seen`, and leaving the third
server-only table outside it makes the advisor's INFO line unreadable as
a signal.

The grant list is deliberately NARROWER than §8b's: a follow row is
created or removed, never edited, so `service_role` gets
`select`/`insert`/`delete` and **not** `update`.
`supabase/tests/rls/server-only-tables.test.js` asserts both the granted
and the withheld privileges.

After it runs: advisor 0008 should clear for `profile_follows`, leaving
`auth_leaked_password_protection` (§7) as the only outstanding security
advisor. The profile endpoints are unaffected — they already use the
service role. There is no UI smoke test; learners never touch this table
from the browser.

Verified red→green against a clean local stack (`supabase db reset
--local`): without the migration exactly one assertion fails — the
missing `profile_follows` deny-all policy — and with it the file's 7
tests and the full 14-file / 129-test RLS suite pass.

### Verification (2026-09-21)

Both migrations were confirmed applied by their **effects**, not just by a
`schema_migrations` stamp — a stamp row alone never proves a migration
took.

- **Migration Drift CI on `main`:** red on 2026-09-18 (before the apply),
  green on 2026-09-19 and 2026-09-20. Drift name-matches, so the
  production version stamps differing from the repo filenames
  (`20260918222912` vs `20260918213000`) is expected and not drift.
- **Production read-only check** (catalog reads only; no DDL, no writes):
  - `is_league_member` exists **only** in schema `private`; the
    `public` function is gone, so `/rpc/is_league_member` is closed.
    `authenticated` holds `EXECUTE` on the private one, as 8a intends.
  - `read my league rows` (`league_members`) and `read my leagues`
    (`leagues`) both evaluate `private.is_league_member(...)` with the
    InitPlan-wrapped `auth.uid()` intact.
  - `rate_limits` and `progress_events_seen` each carry a
    `no client access` policy, `FOR ALL`, `USING false` /
    `WITH CHECK false`.
- **Supabase advisors** (live, not cached): WARN 0029
  `authenticated_security_definer_function_executable` and INFO 0008
  `rls_enabled_no_policy` are both **clear**. The only remaining security
  advisor is `auth_leaked_password_protection`, which is §7 above and
  unrelated to these two migrations.

## 9. Merge the outstanding docs PR if it is still open

`#289` (`chore(docs): mark user roles + admin as shipped`) landed on
`main` 2026-09-18. If another docs-only PR is open when you return, merge
or close it so `docs/BACKLOG.md` owner-action rows do not fork.

## Out of scope (do not do from this list)

- Applying migrations from Cursor / Claude Code / MCP.
- Disabling Google auth in production.
- Deleting users.
- Touching Chat redesign (`ChatTab`, `src/components/chat/**`,
  chat-redesign specs) — Piccolo owns that.

# Mobile auth setup: deep-link redirect URLs

**Owner action.** Native sign-in needs one Supabase dashboard change that no one
without dashboard access can make. Until it is done, magic links and Google
sign-in started in the iOS / Android app open the **website** instead of the
app.

## Why

Inside the native app, every auth flow asks Supabase to redirect to the app's
own URL scheme instead of the website:

| Where the flow starts      | `redirectTo` sent to Supabase               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web (browser / PWA)        | `window.location.origin`, unchanged         |
| Native app (iOS / Android) | `com.sprachschule.deutsch://login-callback` |

Supabase only honours a `redirectTo` that is on the project's **Redirect URLs**
allow-list. Anything else is **silently replaced with the Site URL**, which is
the website. There is no error; the learner just ends up in a browser tab. That
is exactly the bug this setup fixes.

The value is built in `src/lib/nativeApp.js` (`NATIVE_AUTH_CALLBACK_URL`) and
registered with the OS in `ios/App/App/Info.plist` (`CFBundleURLTypes`) and
`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (intent filter, host
`login-callback`). `src/lib/nativeApp.test.js` pins all of them together.

## The change: add one Redirect URL

Supabase dashboard → project `xcnnlczvxmuwcqwychox` → **Authentication → URL
Configuration → Redirect URLs** → **Add URL**:

```
com.sprachschule.deutsch://login-callback
```

- **Keep every existing entry.** The web still needs
  `https://deutsch-app-dusky.vercel.app`, `http://localhost:5173` and
  `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
- **Don't change the Site URL.** It stays the production website.
- **Enter it exactly as shown**, with no trailing slash and no wildcard.
  Supabase appends `?code=…` itself, so no pattern is needed. A wildcard would
  only widen what the allow-list accepts.

After the change, the Redirect URLs list should read:

| Redirect URL                                | Used by              |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `https://deutsch-app-dusky.vercel.app`      | Web (production)     |
| `http://localhost:5173`                     | Local dev            |
| `http://127.0.0.1:5173`                     | Local dev            |
| `com.sprachschule.deutsch://login-callback` | **Native app (new)** |

## What does NOT need changing

- **Google Cloud Console.** Google redirects to Supabase's own callback
  (`https://xcnnlczvxmuwcqwychox.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`), not to the
  app. That URI is already registered (`docs/AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH_RUNBOOK.md` §4).
- **GitHub OAuth app** (PR #347, if it merges): same reason. Its callback is
  Supabase's, and the GitHub button uses the same `redirectTo` as Google.
- **Email templates.** `supabase/templates/magic_link.html` links through
  `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`, which carries the `redirectTo` above. The copy
  "tap this link to sign in in your browser" reads a little oddly now that the
  link opens the app. Rewording it is optional.

## How the native flow behaves (for testing)

- **Google** opens in the system browser (SFSafariViewController on iOS,
  Custom Tabs on Android), not in the app's webview, because Google blocks
  sign-in from embedded webviews. After consent, the app comes back to the
  front and shows "Signing you in…".
- **Magic link:** tap the link in the email on the **same phone** that
  requested it. Native sign-in uses PKCE, so a link only completes on the
  device that asked for it. That is a security property, not a bug:
  intercepting the link through the URL scheme gains nothing. The **6-digit
  code** in the same email works from any device, as before.
- **iOS** may ask "Open in Deutsch App?" the first time. That prompt comes from
  the OS and is expected.

## Verify

1. Build and sync: `npm run build:mobile`. The `VITE_SUPABASE_*` and
   `VITE_GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED` values must be in `.env` when you build, because
   Vite inlines them at build time.
2. Check that the OS routes the scheme to the app without signing in. Each
   command should open the app on a **"Sign-in cancelled"** panel:
   - iOS Simulator:
     `xcrun simctl openurl booted "com.sprachschule.deutsch://login-callback?error=access_denied"`
   - Android emulator / device:
     `adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "com.sprachschule.deutsch://login-callback?error=access_denied" com.sprachschule.deutsch`
3. On a device, sign in with a magic link, then with Google. Both should land
   back **in the app** and show "Signed in".

**If the flow lands on the website instead:** the Redirect URL is missing or
mistyped. Supabase fell back to the Site URL. Re-check the entry character by
character.

## Not covered here

- **Universal Links / App Links** (https-based deep links). These would stop any
  other app from claiming the scheme. PKCE already makes an intercepted
  callback useless, so this is hardening, not a blocker. It needs an
  `apple-app-site-association` / `assetlinks.json` hosted on the domain.
- **App Store Review Guideline 4.8** (login services). Before submitting an
  iOS build that offers Google sign-in, check whether Sign in with Apple is
  required as well.

<sub>Six surfaces, an offline CEFR placement test, and considerably more thought about merge semantics than a language app has any right to contain.</sub>

> [!NOTE]

## ✨ What learners get

| Experience                                  | What it does                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧭 **Offline placement**                    | Nine questions drawn from the course itself place you at A1, A2, or B1 — no account, no AI. |
| 💬 **Guided conversation**                  | An AI tutor sets level-aware scenarios, responds in character, and explains corrections.    |
| 🔤 **Alphabet & listening**                 | German speech synthesis, confusable-letter quizzes, and a browsable pronunciation grid.     |
| 🧠 **Vocabulary & SRS**                     | Practice, browse, and generate decks — preset, lexicon, grammar, and custom — on Leitner.   |
| ✍️ **Adaptive translation**                 | A1 word tiles, A2 fill-in-the-blank drills, and meaning-aware B1 grading.                   |
| 🎮 **Motivation that respects the learner** | XP, streak freezes, achievements, daily quests, and optional weekly leagues.                |

## 🦸 Two things that make it unusual

<details open>
<summary><strong>🔌 Offline-first sync that understands different kinds of data</strong></summary>

The browser's `localStorage` is the offline authority; Supabase is an optional
cross-device layer. Reconciliation happens client-side before PostgREST upserts,
so each state slice gets semantics that fit its data instead of one risky
"newest blob wins" rule.

| State slice                  | Merge strategy                                 | Why                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Daily stats                  | **Additive delta** from a synced baseline      | Repeated syncs stay idempotent without losing offline activity.                          |
| SRS cards                    | **Per-card LWW** on `lastReviewed`             | Reviewing one card should not overwrite another card's state.                            |
| Settings                     | **Whole-record LWW**, with explicit carve-outs | Ordinary preferences share a clock; special data does not.                               |
| CEFR level                   | **Independent LWW clock**                      | A newer unrelated setting cannot roll B1 back to A1.                                     |
| Learned words & deck mastery | **Union merge**                                | Learning on either device remains learned.                                               |
| Custom decks                 | **Per-deck LWW + tombstones**                  | Offline deletion competes with edits by timestamp instead of resurrecting removed decks. |

Deck deletion is the interesting edge case. An upsert-only system cannot express
absence, so a stale device would recreate a deleted deck. Deutsch· keeps a
timestamped tombstone; the same per-deck LWW comparison then decides whether an
edit or deletion is newer.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Daily quests with deterministic variety and zero quest rows</strong></summary>

Three daily quests are derived—not stored—from a stable seed:

```js
seed = hash(`${userId ?? 'guest'}:${todayKey}`);
quests = pickQuestGroups(seed, 3);
progress = readExistingDailyCounters(todayKey);
```

The same learner gets the same quests all day, on every device, even offline.
There is no quest table to maintain, synchronize, or accidentally reshuffle.

Difficulty adapts without chasing outliers. Targets use the **median of the
previous seven days**, excluding today, then apply per-quest multipliers. A
single heroic study binge cannot make tomorrow miserable, and today's progress
cannot move today's goalposts.

Quests intentionally award achievements rather than XP. League XP stays tied to
actual graded practice, protecting the balance of a small, real learning loop.

## ⚡ Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22 (see `.nvmrc`) and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blackhebrewisraeli/deutsch-app.git
cd deutsch-app
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The offline-first learning
flows work with no Supabase, Vercel, or Anthropic credentials at all.

| Command            | Purpose                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`      | Start the Vite UI                |
| `npm run dev:full` | Start Vite plus Vercel functions |
| `npm test`         | Run the main Vitest suite        |
| `npm run lint`     | Run ESLint                       |

Accounts, sync, leagues, avatars, and the AI endpoints each need a little more
setup — local Supabase via Docker, a few `VITE_*` flags, and an
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The full matrix, every npm script, and the usual
"why is sync doing nothing locally?" answer live in

/**
 * Browser smoke for the AUTHENTICATED learning path.
 *
 * Sibling of `smoke-learning-path.mjs`, which walks the same journey as a
 * guest. That one proves local persistence survives a reload. This one is
 * about the half a guest can never reach: the sync lane, leagues, and the
 * account controls.
 *
 * ── What it proves ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   1. A stub session restores without secrets (no real token, no network).
 *   2. Finishing an exercise puts THAT answer's event on the sync wire.
 *   3. A reload rebuilds progress from the server after a local wipe.
 *   4. Leagues renders a real standings table, not the soft error line.
 *   5. Account controls are present and sign-out returns to the guest shell.
 *   6. None of the above overflows or clips at 1280 / 375 / 320.
 *
 * ── Why this builds its own target (do not "simplify" this away) ──────────
 * The signed-in pass seeds a Supabase session into localStorage. A build
 * carrying a developer's REAL VITE_SUPABASE_* REJECTS that seed, and the run
 * dies with "the session seed no longer satisfies useAuth" on a developer box
 * while passing in CI. So with no AUDIT_BASE we build with STUB Supabase
 * config into a scratch dir. Same lesson audit-contrast.mjs documents at
 * length; see its header before changing this.
 *
 * Nothing here is a credential. `isAuthConfigured()` only checks both values
 * are truthy, and every outbound call is intercepted.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run smoke:auth-learning-path                    # builds and serves itself
 *   AUDIT_BASE=http://localhost:5290 node scripts/dev/smoke-auth-learning-path.mjs
 *   AUDIT_SKIP_BUILD=1 npm run smoke:auth-learning-path # reuse dist-smoke-auth/
 *
 * Same AUDIT_BASE / AUDIT_SKIP_BUILD / AUDIT_PORT contract as
 * smoke-learning-path.mjs and audit-contrast.mjs.
 *
 * Exit 0 on a clean walk of all three viewports; 1 on failure. A failing
 * viewport also writes smoke-auth-failure-<name>-<width>.png.

/**
 * STEP 2 — Complete an exercise and check the sync request.  ✅ IMPLEMENTED
 *
 * The lane: answering dispatches `deutsch:progress` → App schedules a flush
 * (500ms) → `flushQueue` POSTs each queued event to
 * `/api/v1/progress/events` with a bearer token. Note this flush is gated on
 * a JWT, NOT on VITE_SYNC_ENABLED — sync off must not strand answers. That is
 * why step 2 works without the flag and step 3 will need it.
 *
 * ── Why this keys on ids and never on counts ─────────────────────────────
 * A first draft asserted "at least as many POSTs as cards answered" and went
 * green reporting 65 events for 3 cards. Those 62 extras are real:
 * `expandGuestBacklog` diffs local daily counters against what the server
 * has, and our `/rest/v1` stub always answers empty, so the whole local day
 * is re-expanded into catch-up events on EVERY flush. They are synthesised
 * to be indistinguishable from real ones — same tab, same level, same
 * dateKey — so no payload filter can separate them either.
 *
 * That assertion would therefore have passed with per-answer sync entirely
 * dead. The fix is to capture the id each answer actually enqueues (the
 * queue tail, see `queueTailId`) and require THOSE exact ids on the wire.
 * If `recordEvent` stops enqueuing, the capture fails; if the flush stops
 * POSTing, the ids never arrive. Backlog noise cannot satisfy either.
 *
 * Asserted here, rather than "no error appeared" — a dead sync lane is
 * silent, so absence of an error is not evidence a request was made:
 *   - one freshly-enqueued event per answered card, ids distinct;
 *   - every one of those ids reaching /api/v1/progress/events;
 *   - each carrying the stub bearer and a well-formed UUID id;
 *   - the payload matching what the learner did (vocab / a1 / de, today,
 *     a real verdict);
 *   - the queue draining, which is the round-trip half: `flushQueue` only
 *     shifts an event off after a 200.

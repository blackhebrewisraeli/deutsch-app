/**
 * Rendered-DOM contrast audit.
 *
 * Walks 2 modes × 6 tabs × 3 viewports with a populated account and
 * reports every text node whose contrast against its nearest opaque background
 * falls below WCAG AA (4.5:1 body / 3:1 large), plus any header popover that
 * renders outside the viewport (a class jsdom and scrollWidth both miss).
 *
 * On top of the tab walk it drives the surfaces a walk cannot reach:
 *   - every header sheet, opened through its own trigger;
 *   - three full-screen modals (sign-in, trial wall, auth callback);
 *   - Chat's model popover, opened through its accessible trigger, with the
 *     four choices asserted present when open and ABSENT when closed;
 *   - Profile → Settings at 320 / 375 / desktop, guest and signed-in, for
 *     contrast and for horizontal fit.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run audit:contrast                         # builds and serves itself
 *   AUDIT_BASE=http://localhost:5290 npm run audit:contrast   # audit a server you already run
 *   AUDIT_SKIP_BUILD=1 npm run audit:contrast      # reuse the last audit build
 *
 * With no AUDIT_BASE this provisions its own target: a production build made
 * with STUB Supabase config, served from a scratch directory. That is not a
 * convenience — it is the difference between the audit running and not. The
 * signed-in pass seeds a session, and a build carrying a developer's REAL
 * VITE_SUPABASE_* rejects that seed, so the audit aborted with "the session
 * seed no longer satisfies useAuth" on every developer machine while passing
 * in CI. The gate was therefore CI-only for as long as that went unfixed, and
 * clipped sheets could only be caught after pushing.
 *
 * Setting AUDIT_BASE means "I am providing the server" and skips all of it,
 * which is the path CI takes — it builds and serves in the workflow so the
 * artifact under audit is the same one the other jobs produce.
 *
 * Exit 1 when any real finding remains (emoji-only nodes are excluded).

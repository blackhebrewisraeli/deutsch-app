   * report, so there is no id for "nothing is due, practise anyway". A card
   * still has to appear — two cards is the layout — so the pack authors them

   *
   * The two land on DIFFERENT practice tabs on purpose. Both labels could
   * plausibly point at Vokabeln, but two cards side by side sending the reader
   * to one place reads as a bug, so each names the tab it actually describes:
   * Übersetzen is the exercise surface, Vokabeln the vocabulary one.

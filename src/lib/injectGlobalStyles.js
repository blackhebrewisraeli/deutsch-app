       browser chrome — verified on a real iPhone, where the splash's gold
       stripe was cut off. 100dvh is the visible height and tracks the bar as
       it hides and shows. The 100vh line stays first as the fallback for
       engines without dvh; both declarations are needed, which is why this is

       PWA alike. An .entry-screen-foot rule padding by that inset used to sit
       here and was inert twice over: the inset resolved to 0, and no element in
       the app ever carried the class.

       (No backticks anywhere in this comment: it lives inside a template
       literal, so one would end the string.)

       The dvh handling above is NOT part of that and IS live: it tracks the
       URL bar, which is independent of viewport-fit. Do not remove it.

       src/safeArea.test.js fails if a safe-area inset reappears here without the
       viewport opt-in landing alongside it. */

    /* ── Modal entrance ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Scrim and card animate SEPARATELY and at different speeds, which is the
       whole trick: the scrim is the context switch and wants to be immediate,
       while the card is the object being handed to you and wants to travel.
       Animating the pair as one block makes the page look like it stuttered.

       0.5s on the card sounds slow read as a number, and is not, because the
       easing is expo-out: roughly three quarters of the distance is covered in
       the first 120ms and the tail is the settle. A linear or ease-out half
       second genuinely would drag. Do not swap the curve without shortening
       the duration to match.

       16px, matching the SPACE[4] step, so the card rises by a real unit of the
       layout rather than an arbitrary nudge. It travels UP, so the motion
       points at where the card ends rather than away from it. */

       A glow that breathes rather than a pulse that blinks: the shadow never

       changes HOW MUCH. A ring that leaves and returns reads as a notification
       badge demanding action; this reads as the pill being warm.

       color-mix over var(--c-accent) rather than a literal, so it is the pack
       accent in both palettes — the same construction pulse-gold uses. 3.2s is

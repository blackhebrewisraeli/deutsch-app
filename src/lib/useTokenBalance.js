 * The signed-in learner's token balance, plus the daily-quest payout.
 *
 * Each quest that is done pays once (server-idempotent on the day+quest key).
 * A quest that FLIPS to done while the app is open shows +10 immediately; the
 * server's returned balance then replaces the optimistic one. A quest that was
 * already done when the balance first loaded is still claimed — it may have
 * been finished offline — but without the optimistic bump, since it has most
 * likely been paid already and a +10 that snaps back would be a lie.
 *
 * `tokens` is null while unknown: signed out, no backend, or the column not
 * yet migrated. No award is attempted while it is null.

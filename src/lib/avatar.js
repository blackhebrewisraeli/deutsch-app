// Avatars: three tiers, one resolver, and a generated fallback that costs
// nothing.
//
//     uploaded image  →  avatar_emoji  →  generated identicon
//
// ONE RESOLVER. Before this, "no avatar" rendered as 🦊 on Home and 🙂
// in ProfileCard — the same absence, drawn two different ways, because each
// call site invented its own fallback inline. Everything now goes through
// avatarFor(), and a guard test fails if a second hard-coded glyph appears.
//
// WHY NOT DICEBEAR. The HTTP API would send every user's id to a third party on
// each render — including other players' ids while a leaderboard paints — and
// re-introduce the CDN dependency the font work deliberately removed. The npm
// package avoids the network but not the bundle. This generator is ~40 lines
// and imports nothing, which priced the dependency out of the decision.

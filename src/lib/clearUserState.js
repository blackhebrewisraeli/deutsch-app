// Theme is a per-device preference (themeMode.js), not account data, so it
// survives. Everything else in localStorage is user-specific: the state blob,
// CEFR level, sync baseline, tutorial/welcome flags, leftover auth tokens.
//
// Sequence is load-bearing:
//   1. await supabase signOut — the session has to die first. Wiping storage
//      while still authenticated would let sync push an empty blob to the
//      account. Reloading before signOut resolves would leave the session.
//   2. clearUserLocalState — so the next hydrate cannot restore XP / SRS.
//   3. window.location.reload() — React memory (stats, learnedWords, level,
//      the gateDismissed latch) has no other bulletproof reset in this SPA.
//      Same-URL assign('/') is a no-op on `/`.

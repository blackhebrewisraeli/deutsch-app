// Claims any unclaimed league-winner rewards into local state when a signed-in
// user loads the app — not only when they open the Leagues tab. Idempotent
// (claimWinnerRewards dedups via gamification.leagueClaimed), so running once
// per sign-in is enough; failures are swallowed so a reward claim never blocks
// the app. The credited bonus XP flows through the normal bonusXp → xpForDay →
// sync path; the gamification recompute picks up the badge on its next run.
//
// A claim MUST be stamped and pushed, not just saved. The claim set is the
// idempotency key, and saveState alone leaves it on this device only: the next
// reconcile pulls a server blob that has never heard of it, and the reward is
// awarded again on the following load (observed: +200 XP per refresh, forever).
// stampSettings gives the write an LWW clock; markDirty schedules the push.
// Nothing else does it for us — the claim credits bonusXp directly rather than
// emitting a progress event, so App's markDirty listener never fires.
//
// onClaimed(count, xp) fires once when a new win is claimed, so the caller can
// surface a celebration toast. It's held in a ref so passing a fresh inline
// callback each render does not re-trigger the effect.

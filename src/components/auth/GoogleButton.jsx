/**
 * "Continue with Google" — the primary CTA on every auth surface once the
 * flag is on.
 *
 * Renders nothing when Google is not configured. The guard lives HERE, not at
 * the three call sites: AuthSheet already self-guards on isAuthConfigured()
 * for exactly this reason, and a per-call-site check is the one someone
 * forgets at the fourth surface.
 *
 * The mark is a static file rendered with <img>, not an inlined SVG. Google's
 * brand terms require it unmodified and un-themed, and it is multicolour hex
 * by definition — which noHardcodedHex.test.js forbids in any component
 * source. vite.config.js's workbox globPatterns already precache **\/*.svg,
 * so it works offline and inside the installed PWA with no config change.
 *
 * The label is Google's required wording: "Continue with Google", not "Sign in
 * with Google" alongside the mark.

// The Profile tab — ONE page.
//
// It replaced a segmented control (STATS / LEAGUES / SETTINGS) that split one
// identity across three destinations, so that the page a learner thinks of as
// "me" never showed who they were, what league they were in, and how they were
// doing at the same time. Nothing here may reintroduce a sub-tab; the guard is
// in UserProfile.test.jsx.
//
// Settings did NOT move into this page. It is a route (`#/settings`) reached
// from the account sheet, which #314 made the one door to it. StatsTab still
// renders the settings panel for that route; this component is what the tab
// shows otherwise.
//
// READING ORDER, top to bottom: who you are → the numbers → your league →
// the standings → the detailed charts. The charts used to open the tab, which
// is why it read as an analytics dashboard rather than a profile.
//
// The identity block is a CARD, not a bare column. Five metric tiles used to be
// the first thing with a border on the page, so the avatar and name floated
// above the design rather than leading it — the portrait read as a bullet in a
// list of facts instead of as the subject of the page. It now sits on its own
// surface with the follower counts it belongs with, at a size that makes it the
// focal point; XP / Level / Streak are a separate, quieter band below.

// The ring is drawn OUTSIDE the image (an outline, not a border) so the avatar
// keeps every pixel of its size instead of losing 8 to its own frame — the
// identicon is generated to fill its box. The matching margin reserves the room
// the outline paints into, which no layout box accounts for.

              recent membership row. Across a settle those are different
              numbers, so the page could say Silver here and Gold there.
              LeaderboardSection now reports the live league up instead of
              rendering its own tier, and `profile.tier` is the fallback for
              the moment before that fetch lands. tierName() makes both ends
              Bronze when there is nothing at all. */}

          Last, deliberately. These are the dense analytics that used to BE
          the Profile tab.

          The extra margin is a measured correction, not decoration. This page
          renders two rhythms: the identity blocks above sit SPACE[5] (20px)
          apart because they are one group — portrait, metrics, league, all
          answering "who am I" — while the sections inside `children` sit
          SPACE[8] (32px) apart. That made the step INTO the analytics region
          smaller than every step within it, so the charts read as one more
          identity block instead of as a new region. SPACE[3] on top of the
          grid's own SPACE[5] brings the boundary up to the same 32px the
          sections below it use. */}
